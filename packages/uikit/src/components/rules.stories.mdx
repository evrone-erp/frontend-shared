## Ui components rules

- Ui component can't depend on outher layers (entities, widgets), but can depend on components from shared layer.
- Ui component must have public interface.
  Other modules can't import files from component directory.
  In component directory should be index file with public fragments re-exports.
  There is eslint rule for it, but it not work with relative imports.
- Ui component must contain stories. There must be stories file in component directory. Stories file name pattern `ComponentName.stories.tsx`
- Ui component must have sx and className props passed to root component element
- Deep customization should be implemented through classNames on nested elements
  classNames pattern `ComponentName-partName` and for state modifications `ComponentName-partName--action`.

Example

```tsx
<BaseDrawer sx={{
  "& .BaseDrawer-body": {
    background: "red",
  },
  "& .BaseDrawer-footer": {
    background: "green",
  },
}}>
```
